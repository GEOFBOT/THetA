1) SUMMARY========================================================================
This software is for estimating tumor purity (fraction of non-cancerous cells)
and clonal/subclonal copy number aberrations from high-throughput DNA
sequencing data for a tumor normal pair.

This document contains the following sections:
1) SUMMARY
2) REQUIREMENTS
3) INSTALLATION/COMPILING
4) BASIC USAGE
5) COMPLETE EXAMPLE
6) OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
7) WHOLE-GENOME PREPROCESSING SCRIPTS
8) WHOLE-EXOME PREPROCESSING SCRIPTS
9) BAF MODEL (see THetA2 paper)


2) REQUIREMENTS===================================================================

Requirements to run:
1. Python 2.7 or higher
	a. numpy (tested with 1.6.2)
	b. scipy (tested with 0.10.1)
  c. joblib (tested with XXXX)
2. *nix OS
3. Java 1.6 (optional, for preprocessing script)


Tested with: Python 2.7, Java 6

3) INSTALLATION==================================================================

(i) Obtain the most recent version of THetA:

	git clone https://github.com/raphael-group/THetA.git

(ii) Install the code.  Run the following command

	./install

     This will compile the Java and will create the following executables.

	bin/RunTHetA
	bin/runBICSeqToTHetA.jar
	bin/getAlleleCounts.jar
	bin/CreateExomeInput

4) BASIC USAGE ===================================================================
This section gives the basic instructions for running THetA.

1. Create an interval_count_file:

The interval_count_file must contain one line per genomic interval.  Each line
is tab delimited containing the following fields:

	1. interval ID (String) - an identifier for the interval
	2. chromosome number (Integer) - chromosome on which the interval
	   occurs
	3. interval start coordinate (Integer) - starting position for the
	   interval
	4. interval end coordinate (Integer) - ending position for the interval
	5. tumorCount (Integer) - number of reads contained within interval for
	   tumor BAM
	6. normalCount (Integer) - number of reads contained within interval for
	   normal BAM
	7. * upperBound (Integer) [Optional] - the maximum copy number to consider for the
		interval.
	8. * lowerBound (Integer) [Optional]- the minimum copy number to consider for the
		interval.

	The interval_count_file may contain an optional header line, starting with
	a "#" symbol.

	ADDITIONAL NOTES for more than one tumor population:
	After running for a single tumor population, THetA now produces a .bash
	script [prefix].RunN3.bash that can be run to consider more than one tumor
	population. This is the recommended way to run THetA for multiple tumor
	populations.


	NOTE: See the section on WHOLE-GENOME PREPROCESSING SCRIPTS to see how to convert
		  BIC-Seq output into THetA input.

	NOTE: See the section on WHOLE-EXOME PREPROCESSING SCRIPTS to see how to convert
		 Whole-exome data (with specific support for ExomeCNV and EXCAVATOR)
		 into THetA input.

2. Create tumor_SNP_file and normal_SNP file. These tow files should be for a
   single set of potential SNP sites. (Optional)

  NOTE: While this step is optional, it is highly recommended as THetA2 is much improved
  (including significantly faster) than previous versions when this input is provided.

  There are two supported formats for these files.

  Format 1: A tab delimited file with the following columns
    (1) chromosome (Integer) - Chromosome on which a germline SNP may occur.
    (2) position (Integer) - Genomic coordinate of potential SNP position.
    (3) ref_allele - The number of reads aligning to the position with the reference allele.
    (4) mut_allele - The number of reads aligning to the position with the mutant allele.

  NOTE: The above file format may be either uncompressed or compressed as **.tar.gz

  Format 2: A tab delimited file with the following columns.
    (1) Chrm (Integer)
    (2) pos (Integer)
    (3) A -  # reads with A at this position
    (4) C - # reads with C at this position
    (5) G - # reads with G at this position
    (6) T - # reads with T at this position
    (7) Total - the # reads at this position
    (8) refCount - # reads with the reference allele for this position
    (9) mutCount - # reads with the mutant allele for this position

  NOTE: We provide scripts to create the above file format.  See the BAF section
        of this manual for instructions.

3. Run Main Code:

	* bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file [Options]

  * bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --TUMOR_FILE tumor_SNP_file --NORMAL_FILE normal_SNP_file [Options]

	NOTES: This script will consider both the case of a normal and one tumor
		subpopulation as well as a normal and two tumor subpopulations, then
		choose the best solution.

	INPUT:
	* interval_count_file: input file with genomic intervals and read depth
	  counts (format above)
  * tumor_SNP_file and normal_SNP_file: input files with read counts for
    potential germline SNPs (format above) [Optional, but recommended]
	* [Options] - see later section on all optional parameters.

	OUTPUT:
	* results files: the set of all maximum likelihood solutions found.
	  Each solution will be a single line in this file with fields:
		1. NLL (Double) - solution neg. log likelihood (w/o constants)
		2. mu  (Double,Double) - comma delimited list:  %normal, %tumor
		3. C_2 (Integer: ... :Integer) - colon delimited list of
		   inferred tumor interval copy numbers.  When multiple tumor
		   populations are inferred this list is in the form
		   (Integer,Integer: ... : Integer, Integer).
		4. p* (Double, ... ,Double) - comma delimted list of inferred
		   multinomial parameter \widehat{C\mu}
		The chosen solution will be in a file with postfix ".BEST.results".
		THetA will also output the individual solutions for n=2 and n=3 in
		in files ending in ".n3.results" and ".n3.results" respectively
	* results plots: PDFs that visualize the results will automatically be created.
	* bounds files: a copy of the interval_count_file with additional
	  columns for the upper and lower bounds used for the copy number
      	  estimate of each genomic interval for n=2 and n=3 (see example for details).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) COMPLETE EXAMPLE ==========================================================

	bin/RunTHetA example/PD4120a.intervals

Runs THetA for the case of normal and one tumor subpopulation, as well as normal and two tumor
subpopulations. By default, the algorithm uses a bound heuristic to set reasonable lower
and upper bounds on the copy number considered for each interval. For this input,
the program will take ~5 minutes to complete using a single process and will produce
three files (or four if you have matlab installed):

Results Files:
File 1: PD4120a.n2.results
containing a single solution with 34.5% normal and 65.4% tumor, output in the following format
(only part of the output is written here as indicated by ...)

** Notice that only the tumor components of C are written.  It is assumed that the normal component contains all segments with the expected copy number. **

File 3: PD4120a.BEST.results
In this case, as indicated by command line output, the solution consisting of a normal
and two tumor subpopulations is selected. PD4120a.BEST.results will contain a copy of
PD4120a.n3.results

Visualization Files:
a pdf visualization of the results from THetA, similar to those seen in the original publication.

N = 3 Script:
File 1: example/PD4120a.RunN3.bash
a script that can be run to rerun analysis of n = 3 while considering a mixture of normal cells
and two distinct tumor populations.

NOTES:
- example/ contains the example described above - created from real data:

 PD4120a.intervals:

	a) tumor and normal read depths determined from BAM files described in:
	Nik-Zainal, S. et al. (2012) The Life History of 21 Breast Cancers.
	Cell, 149, 5:994-1007.

	b) genomic intervals determined by
		(1) running the algorithm (with default parameter lambda = 2) described in:
		Xi, R. et al. (2011) Copy number variation detection in whole-genome
		sequencing data using the Bayesian information criterion. PNAS, 108,
		46:E1128-E1136.
		(2) Removal of all intervals less than 50 Kb in length.

6) OPTIONAL PARAMETERS=========================================================

Basic Options: There are a variety of optional parameters that can be passed to THetA

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) --NUM_PROCESSES (Integer) -- The number of processes to use for computation.
				    Using more processes increases memory usage, but can also
					provide significant speed-ups.

		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --NUM_PROCESSES 8

		Default: 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) --OUTPUT_PREFIX, -p (String) -- allows the user to specify a different prefix for
					the output files.

		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --OUTPUT_PREFIX (-p) prefix

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) --DIRECTORY, -d (String) -- allows the user to specify a target directory for
					 output files


		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --DIR (-d) /path/to/directory

		Default : ./

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4) --MAX_NORMAL, -m (Double) -- allows the user the change the maximum fraction of
					normal admixture in the sample. This is only enforced
					for the case of N=2 (normal and one tumor)

		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --MAX_NORMAL (-m) 0.5

		Default: 0.5

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) --TAU, -t (Integer) -- the expected copy in the normal genome

		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --TAU (-t) 2

		Default: 2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(6) --MAX_K, -k (Integer) -- the maximum copy number to consider in the genome

		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --MAX_K (-k) 3

		Default: 3

		NOTE: Use of BOUND_HEURISTIC may allow copy numbers greater than
			  MAX_K when read depth strongly support that case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(7) --BOUND_HEURISTIC (Double) --  allows user to decide if to use bound heuristic
					for setting lower and upper bounds on the copy number
					considered for each interval.

		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --BOUND_HEURISTIC 0.5

		Default: 0.5

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(8) --NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC (Integer) -- allows a user to set a different value
					for the expected copy number in a tumor. When this
					parameter is supplied, the lower and upper bounds
					for the copy numbers tested for each interval depend
					on the values set for the parameters HEURISTIC_LB and
					HEURISTIC_UB.  See those parameters for more details.

		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC 2

		Default: Not applied

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(9) --HEURISTIC_LB (Double) -- Only applies if the NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC has been
					supplied.  All intervals with tumor/normal read
					depth ratio less than HEURISTIC_LB will have lower
					bound of 0 and upper bound of NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC.
					All intervals with tumor/normal read depth ratio
					greater than HEURISTIC_LB but less than HEURISTIC_UB
					will be give an copy number of NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC.
					All intervals with tumor/normal read depth ratio
					greater than HEURISTIC_UB will have a lower bound of
					HEURISTIC_UB and an upper bound of MAX_K.


		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC 2 --HEURISTIC_LB 0.85

		Default: 0.9 (when NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC is supplied)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(10) --HEURISTIC_UB (Double) -- Only applies if the NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC has been
					 supplied.  All intervals with tumor/normal read
					 depth ratio less than HEURISTIC_LB will have lower
					 bound of 0 and upper bound of NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC.
					 All intervals with tumor/normal read depth ratio
					 greater than HEURISTIC_LB but less than HEURISTIC_UB
					 will be give an copy number of NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC.
					 All intervals with tumor/normal read depth ratio
					 greater than HEURISTIC_UB will have a lower bound of
					 HEURISTIC_UB and an upper bound of MAX_K.


		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC 2 --HEURISTIC_UB 1.2

		Default: 1.1 (when NORMAL_BOUND_HEURISTIC is supplied)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(11) --NO_MULTI_EVENT (Boolean Flag) -- Prohibits multiple distinct copy number events
					to be predicted for a single interval.
					If set, a perfect phylogeny assumption
					is made for all copy number events over
					all tumor populations.

		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --NO_MULTI_EVENT

		Default: False

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(12) --NO_INTERVAL_SELECTION (Boolean Flag) -- Turns off automatic interval selection
						for determining which intervals should
						be used in the optimization procedure.
						When set to TRUE all supplied intervals
						are used.  WARNING - this may result in
						very long run-times.

		Usage: bin/RunTHetA interval_count_file --NO_INTERVAL_SELECTION

		Default: False

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Options: The following options should only be used when running THetA
directly from the python file, instead of the provided bash script. The python
file only runs theta for one value of N (number of tumor populations) and doesn't
incorportate model selection.

(13) --N, -n (Integer) -- the number of subpopulations to consider. 2 for mixture of
				normal and one tumor population. 3 for mixture of normal and
				two tumor populations and requires the use of either
				the --RESULTS flag or the --NO_INTERVAL_SELECTION
				flag.

		Usage: python/RunTHetA.py interval_count_file --N (-n) 2

		Default: 2

		NOTE: If you want to run for a value of 3, first running with
		      a value of 2 (the default) will now output a bash script
		      of the name [prefix].RunN3.bash that can be run to
		      automatically do analysis with a value of 3 (or multiple
		      tumor populations).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(14) --BOUNDS_ONLY (Boolean Flag) -- Calculates the bounds with the specified
					heuristic values and writes out a .withBounds file without
					running the rest of the program.

		Usage: python/RunTHetA.py interval_count_file --BOUNDS_ONLY

github raphael-group theta		Default: False

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(15) --NUM_INTERVALS (Integer) -- Changes the maximum number of intervals used
			in the high confidence step of the two step processes.

		Usage: python/RunTHetA.py interval_count_file --NUM_INTERVALS 50

		Defualt: 100 for n=2, 20 for n=3

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(16) --RESULTS (String) -- A results file output from a run with one tumor population
			   (-n 2 or --N 2).  Either the --RESULTS or
			   --NO_INTERVAL_SELECTION flag is required when considering
			   multiple tumor populations (-n 3 or --N 3).

		Usage: python/RunTHetA.py interval_count_file -n 3 --RESULTS result_file

		Default: No default. Required for multiple tumor populations (-n 3 or --N 3).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7) WHOLE-GENOME PREPROCESSING SCRIPTS==============================================

While THetA can be used with any segmentation algorithm applied to whole-genome data,
we provide code to convert BIC-Seq output (from their perl pipeline) into the
appropriate input for THetA since that is what we use in the results presented
in our paper.  With the latest version of THetA, we suggest running BIC-Seq
with the *default* parameters (i.e. lambda=2).

BIC-Seq can be obtained from: http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/Supplements/PNAS11.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run Code:

	* java -jar bin/runBICSeqToTHetA.jar file.bicseg [Options]


INPUT:

8) WHOLE-EXOME PREPROCESSING SCRIPTS==========================================

The most recent THetA release works with Exome data.  Once you have created
input data for THetA for whole-exome data, there is no difference in how you
run the algorithm.  We include here a script that can be used with any algorithm
that segments (and predicts copy numbers) from whole-exome data to create THetA
input.  In particular, we provide specific support for segmentations determined
from running ExomeCNV and EXCAVATOR.  We also note that the program CNVKit
provides built in support for generating the input required by THetA.

ExomeCNV can be obtained from here:
https://secure.genome.ucla.edu/index.php/ExomeCNV_User_Guide

EXCAVATOR can be obtained from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/excavatortool/

CNVKit for producing the input to THetA:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(9) BAF Model==================================================================

The most recent paper on THetA2 included a generative model of BAFs that can be
used to distinguish between equally likely solutions determined using read depth
alone.  We now include scripts that will allow a user to to use this generative
model to select the tumor reconstruction where the likelihood of the observed
BAF is the highest under this generative model.  This requires a two-step
process described below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS
	(1) Java
	(2) *nix OS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Obtain BAF information:  First we provide a script that can be used to
	obtain observed BAF information for a provided BAM file and set of
	candidate SNP positions.  This step must be followed for both tumor and
	normal BAM files, using the same SNP_FILE.

RUN CODE

	* java -jar bin/getAlleleCounts.jar config_file

	* INPUT:
	 config_file - a file with the following format:

		SNP_FILE=/full/path/to/SNP/file
		OUTPUT_PREFIX=/prefix/to/use/for/output/files
		BAM_FILE=/full/path/to/BAM/file

	    	where:

		SNP_FILE - A tab delimted file with the following fields for a set of
			   potential SNP sites.
			(1) ID - a unique identifier (e.g. rs#####)
			(2) Chrm (must be numeric)
			(3) pos (the position in the chromosome)
			(4) strand (+/-)
			(5) refAllele - the allele in the reference genome (A/C/G/T)
			(5) mutAllele - the mutant allele (A/C/G/T)

		*** Several SNP_FILES for the SNPs on the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array can be
		    downloaded from: http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/projects/theta/

	* OUTPUT:
		OUTPUT_PREFIX.withCounts - A tab delimited file with the following columns.
			(1) Chrm
			(2) pos
			(3) A -  # reads with A at this position
			(4) C - # reads with C at this position
			(5) G - # reads with G at this position
			(6) T - # reads with T at this position
			(7) Total - the # reads at this position
			(8) refCount - # reads with the reference allele (indicated in SNP file)
			(9) mutCount - # reads with the mutant allele (indicated in SNP file)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of the data under the BAF model described
	in the THetA2 paper.  We provide a script that will calculate the
	likelihood of the BAF data for the models output by THetA(2).

RUN_CODE

	There are two ways to calculate the likelihood of the BAF data:

	1. In conjunction with THetA - You can set parameters when running THetA to distinguish between equally likely
	   solutions immediatly after the solutions have been calculated. To do so, add the following arguments to THetA:

		* --BAF (Boolean Flag): Include this flag as an option to indicate that you want THetA to automatically distinguish
	   						   between equally likely solutions.
	   	* --TUMOR_SNP (String): The location of the tumor SNP file.
	   	* --NORMAL_SNP (String): The location of the normal SNP file.

		If you run the BAF model in this way, the results of running the BAF model will be saved to the same directory as
		the rest of the THetA output.

	2. As a separate process - You can calculate the likelihood of the data under the BAF model by running the model as
	   a standalone program from the rest of THetA. To do so, execute the following command:

	   	python python/RunBAFModel.py TUMOR_SNP NORMAL_SNP INTERVALS RESULTS [-P] [-O] [--PLOT_OPTION] [--M] [--WIDTH] [--HEIGHT] [--G]

	  The parameters for RunBAFModel.py are described below:

	  	* TUMOR_SNP (String): The location of the tumor SNP file.
	  	* NORMAL_SNP (String): The location of the normal SNP file.
	  	* INTERVALS (String): The location of the intervals file that is provided as input for THetA.
	  	* RESULTS (String): The location of the results file that is produced as output by THetA.
	  	* -P (String): The prefix of the output file. This defaults to the prefix of the results file.
	  	* -O (String): The output directory. This defaults to the users current directory.
	  	* --PLOT_OPTION (String): Choose whether to plot the likelihood calculated for all solutions ("ALL") or for only the optimal solution ("BEST")
	  	* --M (String): The probabilistic model used to calculate the likelihood. Currently, only "gaussian" is supported.
	  	* --WIDTH (Float): The width of the output plot. This defaults to 12 inches.
	  	* --HEIGHT (Float): The height of the output plot. This defaults to 12 inches.
	  	* --G (Float): The gamma parameter used for setting the confidence interval that determines if a SNP is heterozygous.
